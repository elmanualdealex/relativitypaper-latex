\section{Introduction}

At the beginning of the 20th century, physics was at a crossroads.
Classical mechanics, as established by Isaac Newton in the 17th century,
had been remarkably successful in explaining the motion of planets,
projectiles, and everyday phenomena. Likewise, James Clerk Maxwell's
electromagnetic theory had unified electricity and magnetism into a
single coherent framework.

However, certain experimental results, most notably the Michelson–Morley
experiment (1887), challenged the classical concepts of absolute space
and time. The inability to detect the motion of the Earth through the
so-called ``luminiferous aether'' suggested that the foundations of
classical physics required revision.

In 1905, Albert Einstein published his paper ``On the Electrodynamics of
Moving Bodies,'' which laid the foundation of what is now known as the
Special Theory of Relativity. This theory discarded the notion of an
absolute frame of reference and replaced it with two simple but
revolutionary postulates, fundamentally changing our understanding of
space and time.

Later, in 1915, Einstein extended his ideas to include gravitation,
developing the General Theory of Relativity. In this theory, gravity is
no longer a force acting at a distance, as Newton had proposed, but a
manifestation of the curvature of space-time itself.

The two theories together form one of the pillars of modern physics,
providing the framework to understand phenomena ranging from subatomic
particles to the dynamics of galaxies and the evolution of the universe.

\section{Special Relativity Fundamentals}

\subsection{Postulates of Special Relativity}
Einstein formulated the Special Theory of Relativity based on two
postulates:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.
\item The speed of light in a vacuum, $c \approx 3 \times 10^{8}$ m/s,
  is constant and independent of the motion of the source or observer.
\end{enumerate}

These assumptions, though simple in appearance, implied a radical change
in the notions of space and time. Events that were considered absolute
in Newtonian mechanics became relative, depending on the observer’s frame.

\subsection{Lorentz Transformations}
To reconcile the invariance of the speed of light with mechanics,
the Lorentz transformations were introduced. For two frames of reference
$S$ and $S'$ where $S'$ moves at a constant velocity $v$ relative to $S$
along the $x$-axis, the coordinates transform as:

\begin{align}
  t' &= \gamma \left( t - \frac{vx}{c^2} \right), \\
  x' &= \gamma (x - vt), \\
  y' &= y, \\
  z' &= z,
\end{align}

where the Lorentz factor is defined as:

\begin{equation}
  \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
\end{equation}

These transformations ensure that the speed of light remains invariant
in all inertial frames.

\subsection{Time Dilation and Length Contraction}

One of the most striking consequences of Lorentz transformations is
the relativity of time and space measurements.

\paragraph{Time Dilation.}
Consider a clock moving at velocity $v$ with respect to an observer.
If the proper time interval measured by the moving clock is $\Delta \tau$,
the time interval measured by the observer is:

\begin{equation}
  \Delta t = \gamma \, \Delta \tau =
  \frac{\Delta \tau}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
\end{equation}

Thus, moving clocks appear to run slower when viewed from a stationary
frame of reference.

\paragraph{Length Contraction.}
Similarly, the length of an object measured parallel to the direction
of motion contracts according to:

\begin{equation}
  L = \frac{L_0}{\gamma},
\end{equation}

where $L_0$ is the proper length (measured at rest).
This implies that moving objects appear shorter along the axis of motion.

\subsection{Relativity of Simultaneity}

Events that are simultaneous in one reference frame may not be simultaneous
in another. Suppose two events occur at positions $x_1$ and $x_2$ at the same
time $t$ in frame $S$. In a moving frame $S'$, the time difference between
the events is given by:

\begin{equation}
  \Delta t' = \gamma \left( \Delta t - \frac{v \Delta x}{c^2} \right).
\end{equation}

If $\Delta x \neq 0$, then $\Delta t' \neq 0$, meaning the events are
no longer simultaneous. This challenges the classical concept of
absolute time.

\section{General Relativity}

\subsection{Equivalence Principle}

Einstein's General Theory of Relativity extends the ideas of Special Relativity
to include gravity. A cornerstone of the theory is the \textbf{Equivalence Principle},
which states that locally, the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from
acceleration. For example, an observer inside a closed elevator cannot tell
whether the force they feel is due to gravity or uniform acceleration.

\subsection{Curvature of Space-Time}

In General Relativity, gravity is not a force acting at a distance as in Newtonian
physics, but a manifestation of the curvature of space-time caused by mass-energy.
Objects move along geodesics—paths of least action—in this curved geometry.

Mathematically, the curvature is described by the \textbf{metric tensor} $g_{\mu\nu}$,
which defines the infinitesimal space-time interval:

\begin{equation}
  ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu,
\end{equation}

where $dx^\mu$ are the differential coordinates in four-dimensional space-time.

\subsection{Einstein Field Equations}

The Einstein Field Equations relate the curvature of space-time to the energy
and momentum of matter and radiation:

\begin{equation}
  G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}

where $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor describing curvature, $T_{\mu\nu}$
is the stress-energy tensor, $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant, $G$ is
Newton's gravitational constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.

\subsection{Notable Solutions}

Some exact solutions of the field equations have important physical interpretations:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Schwarzschild Solution:} describes the space-time around a
  non-rotating spherical mass; predicts black holes and event horizons.
\item \textbf{Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) Metric:} used
  in cosmology to model an expanding universe.
\end{itemize}

\section{Applications and Implications}

\subsection{Global Positioning System (GPS)}
The GPS relies on a constellation of satellites orbiting the Earth.
Due to their high speed and weaker gravitational field compared to the
Earth's surface, both special and general relativistic effects must
be taken into account to maintain accurate positioning.
Clocks on satellites experience a combination of time dilation and
gravitational time shift, which if uncorrected, would result in
errors of several kilometers per day.

\subsection{Cosmology and Universe Expansion}
General Relativity provides the framework for modern cosmology.
The FLRW metric allows modeling an expanding universe, leading
to predictions such as the Big Bang and cosmic microwave background radiation.
Relativistic models also explain the dynamics of dark energy and the
observed accelerated expansion of the universe.

\subsection{Black Holes and Astrophysics}
The Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions describe black holes.
Phenomena such as gravitational lensing, event horizons,
and Hawking radiation are direct consequences of General Relativity.
Observations of binary pulsars, gravitational waves, and the recent
Event Horizon Telescope image confirm these predictions.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}

Einstein's theories of Special and General Relativity have fundamentally
altered our understanding of space, time, and gravity.
The Special Theory introduced the concept that measurements of time and space
depend on the relative motion of observers, challenging the Newtonian notion
of absolute time. The General Theory further revolutionized physics by
describing gravity not as a force but as the curvature of space-time caused
by mass-energy.

Experimental confirmations, such as time dilation observed in particle
accelerators, precise GPS satellite synchronization, gravitational lensing,
and direct detection of gravitational waves, validate these theories
to remarkable accuracy.

Applications extend from astrophysics to cosmology and technology,
demonstrating the pervasive influence of relativity in both theoretical
and practical domains. Future research, particularly in merging relativity
with quantum mechanics, promises to deepen our understanding of the universe
and potentially uncover new physics.

In conclusion, the theories of relativity are not only cornerstones of modern
physics but also indispensable tools for scientific and technological progress.
